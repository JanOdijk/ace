Tool to check Alpino syntactic structures

This tool was developed and used in the Utrecht University AnnCor project in which the automatically generated Alpino syntactic structures were manually checked and if needed corrected.
The tool checks whether Alpino structures are correct, both formally and linguistically and issues errors or warning of different degrees if this is not the case or likely not the case.
